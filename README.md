## Building a Multiplayer Piano the "Wrong" Way

Let's learn and use web standards in an unconventional way ðŸ¥³ ... we're building a Piano you can play with friends. That in and of itself isn't very interesting, but we're going to be using:

- <a href="https://remix.run">Remix</a>
- Forms
- Web Audio (mostly via Tone.js)
- `<meta>`, `<progress>` and more
- Browser history
- Progressive enhancement
- Server-sent events

## But why?

A more conventional approach might be just to require client-side JavaScript and use websockets, or to leverage media streams. Why do it this way?

If you can use Remix to build a progressively enhanced, server-rendered, interactive multiplayer piano that works without JavaScript, _and_ you can do it just as easily as other approaches, then why not do the same for traditional web apps, where the benefits are even greater? ðŸ¤”
